A fork of


CDM: The Console Display Manager
================================

that has a "synchronous" option that makes cdm wait for startx to complete
so that it can be used as a login shell.


Invocation
----------

To run cdm, use

    $ cdm [RCFILE]

cdm tries to source configuration files in this order, and uses the first
existing one:

    [RCFILE specified on command line]
    $HOME/.cdmrc
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cdm/cdmrc
    /etc/cdmrc

To autostart cdm when you log in your account, copy the content of
/usr/share/doc/cdm/profile.sh to the tail of your shell profile (~/.profile,
etc.).


Customisation
-------------

See /etc/cdmrc for examples.
